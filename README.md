- **Python Digital Twin (latest modular implementation)**
  - **Runner:** `Python/main.py`
  - **GUI layer:** `Python/gui_window.py`
  - **Physics backend:** `Python/physics_engine.py`
- **Legacy Python single-file app:** `Python/TrainsientDigitalTwin.py`

## PY-BEMCS Demo

<p align="center">
  <i>This simulation demonstrates Xe+ beam extraction of a dual-grid ion optics system for Vscreen=1650V and Va=-350V ,n_plasma=1e16/m3 without a neutralizer. As the primary and the CEX ions erode the screen/accelerator grid, geometry and potential barriers evolve in time. The secondary electrons are emitted due to the impact of primary beam ions and the charge exchange ions on the grids.</i>

### Key Features

### Core Physics

- **Vectorized particle updates** for high-throughput runtime performance.
- **Reduced electron mass (m_e = M_Xe/100)** to speed up the simulation time.
- **Self-consistent beam extraction** from plasma meniscus and Bohm criteria.
- **CEX collision modeling** with probabilistic scattering, with user defined region in the source code.
- **Dynamic erosion and failure logic** due to CEX ions with in-situ remeshing behavior.

### Python Multiphysics Additions (Latest)
- **Poisson field update with space charge** using both ion and electron density contributions.
- **Neutralizer electron model** with configurable electron injection rate and electron temperature.
- **Thermal-erosion coupling** with simulation modes:
  - `Both`
  - `Thermal`
  - `Erosion`
- **Thermal telemetry** for screen and accelerator grids.

### Visualization and Data export

- Live plasma and damage-map plots.
- Electron backstreaming and beam divergence telemetry.
- Grid temperature map visualization.
- CSV export (iteration, electron backstreaming potential, divergence, grid temperatures).
- GIF recording/export via Pillow.

## Installation and Usage

- Current release only simulates physics for Xe+ ions (This is an ongoing project).

### MATLAB Workflow

1. Prerequisite: MATLAB R2015b or newer.
2. Open MATLAB in the repository root.
3. Run:

```matlab
TransientDigitalTwin  % Grid erosion and EOL study
charge_exchange_code  % Plume/CEX study
```

### Python Workflow (Recommended, Modular)

1. Use Python 3.10+.
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib PyQt5 Pillow
```

3. Launch the modular app:

```bash
python Python/main.py
```

### Python Workflow (Legacy Single File)

```bash
python Python/TrainsientDigitalTwin.py
```
